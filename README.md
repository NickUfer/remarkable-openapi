# reMarkable OpenAPI 3 Definitions

OpenAPI 3 definitions for the reMarkable APIs.

## What needs to be done

- [ ] Add usage instructions and examples
- [X] Add all endpoints
- [ ] Add documentation for all endpoints (endpoints itself, fields)

Probably not possible without workarounds:
- [ ] Add endpoints of the reMarkable web app

## How To Use
